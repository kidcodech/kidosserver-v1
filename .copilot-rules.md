# Copilot Behavior Rules

## Code Changes Policy

**CRITICAL**: Only make code changes when explicitly requested with clear action words.

### When to CODE:
- User says: "implement", "code", "fix", "change", "update", "add", "modify", "create", "write"
- User gives explicit permission: "go ahead", "do it", "make the change"

### When to ONLY RESEARCH (NO CODE CHANGES):
- User says: "research", "investigate", "check", "look", "find", "analyze", "explain"
- User asks questions without action words
- User reports an issue without asking for a fix

### If Uncertain:
- Describe what you would change
- Ask for explicit confirmation before making changes
- Do NOT assume user wants code changes from bug reports

## Examples

❌ WRONG:
```
User: "research why IP filtering isn't working"
Copilot: *makes code changes*
```

✅ CORRECT:
```
User: "research why IP filtering isn't working"  
Copilot: *reads files, analyzes, explains findings* "Would you like me to fix this?"
```

✅ CORRECT:
```
User: "fix the IP filtering issue"
Copilot: *makes code changes*
```

---
**Remember**: The user builds and tests their own code. Don't rush to fix things they haven't asked you to fix.
